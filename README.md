## Your Spiritual Connection App

This is a mock up of an application interface which allows the user to add resources, such as websites, books, and podcasts.

The instructions were to:
+ Initialize a git repo
+ Mock up an application interface
+ Create a base layout using a CSS pre-processor
- I used SCSS and Grunt to process it into CSS
+ Add animation example using CSS
- On the top navigation, animation is used to transition the links on hover
+ Add an example of responsive layout
- The columns are responsive, they will move from 3-wide down to 1-wide based on the screen size
- The columns and input fields at 500px wide will reduce down to 75% width
- The background image is also responsive
+ Add as many 3rd party tools as you'd like
- I used SCSS, Grunt, JavaScript

**To View the App**
+ Click on the link to view it on GitHub pages

**How to Use the App**
+ Enter text into the blank field next to "Add"
+ Click "Add"
+ The added item then moves to the bottom under the "Edit/Delete" column
+ The item can then be edited or deleted by clicking on "Edit" or "Delete"
+ After editing an item, it can then be saved by clicking on "Save" and can be edited again by clicking "Save" again

Questions I had were:
+ How in depth should this app be? The login/forum/home buttons on the nav bar are only for show they do not link to anything.


Thoughts I had were:
+ The second and third columns can be viewed at this time, but the "Add/Edit/Delete" buttons are not working. The HTML needs to be modified because I believe the JavaScript is reading only the first column due to the "this" function being used, and some IDs are being used as well.
